      <h2>AI Web Browsers</h2>
      <p>
        The future of web browsers involves a significant shift from passive tools to dynamic, AI-driven platforms that act as intelligent assistants and central security hubs. Key trends include the integration of AI for enhanced security, personalized user experiences, and streamlined workflows, the emergence of enterprise browsers as core productivity and security platforms, and a move toward Web 4.0 concepts that blend physical and digital realities through AR/VR. Browsers are evolving into more robust, AI-powered agents capable of managing complex tasks and securing digital interactions across workforces and personal use.
      </p>
      <h2>AI Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        Future browser accessibility features will heavily integrate AI for tasks like automated alt text and image description, and AI-powered navigation assistance. Other key advancements include improved voice navigation, broader adoption of eye-tracking and haptic feedback, and enhanced integration of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). Future browsers will support a wider range of assistive technologies and devices.
